# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML-AI
This project applies machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to detect breast cancer from cell image features. The dataset is preprocessed, models are trained and evaluated, and the best-performing model is identified for accurate cancer detection.
